This quiz uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is 3 different JS file and 2 HTML files. 
Project was built to have a better understanding of local storage, callback functions, DOM manipulations, JSON, createElements and preventDefault(). I also learnt the importance of where to put functions and variables related to which HTML when using JS- this is my first time creating a project with multiple files.
